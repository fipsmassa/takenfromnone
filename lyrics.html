        <h2>Festival Tent Time Stories</h2>

        <p>Went in her tent for a coffee<br>
          We did unspeakable things</p>

        <p>Hope she'll not tell her mother<br>
          Some of our dirty things</p>

        <p>And that’s one of her tent time stories<br>
          and there is no time for worries</p>

        <p>And she was always pretty shy<br>
          but rock music makes her high</p>

        <p>When the Bass really roars<br>
          And the guitar just yells<br>
          she wanna tears her clothes off</p>

        <p>And that’s one of her tent time stories<br>
          Festival Time – and there is no time for worries</p>

        <p>Here she finally feels free<br>
          without the worries in her head</p>

        <p>She's just waiting for it<br>
          without knowing what it is</p>

        <p>And that’s one of her tent time stories<br>
          and there is no time for worries</p>

        <p>She‘s not really abcent<br>
          with ten dollars in her hand<br>
          she buys something to smoke<br>
          she like the taste of dope<br>
          on her little tounge</p>

        <p>And that’s one of her tent time stories<br>
          Festival Time – and there is no time for worries</p>

        <p>Now look at her, how she dance<br>
          like shes somewhere else</p>

        <p>Now look at her (look at her), and how she smiles (how she smiles)<br>
          like you where someone else</p>

        <p>Now look at you (look at you), and how you gaze (how you gaze)<br>
          like you're invisible</p>

        <p>So make the first (make the first), the first step (first step)<br>
          For a never ending night, a never ending night.</p>

        <p>And that’s one of her tent time stories<br>
          Festival Time – and there is no time for worries<br>
          And that’s one of her tent time stories<br>
          Festival Time – and there is no time for worries</p>

          For them it’s a land of milk and honey,<br>
          No one wanna work, just rip the money.</p>

        <h2>Holy Moly</h2>

        <p>The sun's been shinin' down on the day and night<br>
          Gettin' away with your sins, livin' a lucky life<br>
          All good things finally come to an end<br>
          And anything bad will catch you up someday</p>

        <p>Walking away is always easier but dumb<br>
          You won't admit, but i know that it's true</p>

        <p>When you got nothing left to lose<br>
          That seems to be good, but I'm not sure if that's true<br>
          You carry the pain around and that's what others see in you<br>
          When you running out through world</p>

        <p>Told by the way you hang your head<br>
          The way you cast your eyes and things you haven't said<br>
          You've gathered past ten years written on your face<br>
          Your whole damn life's seems like a lie</p>

        <p>Walking away is always easier but dumb<br>
          You won't admit, but i know that it's true</p>

        <p>When you got nothing left to lose<br>
          That seems to be good, but I'm not sure if that's true<br>
          You carry the pain around and that's what others see in you<br>
          When you running out through world</p>

        <p>Everybody knows that she broke your heart<br>
          Everybody knows that it's tearing you apart<br>
          Everybody goes there whether they want to or not<br>
          Everybody starts to hold on to what they got</p>

        <p>When you got nothing left to lose<br>
          That seems to be good, but I'm not sure if that's true<br>
          You carry the pain around and that's what others see in you<br>

        <p>As they all sitting there in their backyards<br>
          Parent lifes with house, Kids and dogs<br>
          And now look at us like we sitting here alone<br>
          In the dirt in the mid of Million other people</p>

        <p>Rushing behind, their boring everyday<br>
          we shout the loudest but we're lost in the gray crowd</p>

        <p>Now look at us like we do not act even thought it's the only solution<br>
          and i know there are people who say all this things don't happen<br>
          and i know this will be all stories some day, but right know this moments are</p>
        not stories this is happening i am here

        <p>And i thought i never die for you<br>
          and i thought i never try for you<br>
          but know you reign my world<br>
          And i thought i never die for you<br>
          and i thought i never try for you<br>
          but know you reign my world<br>
          And it is one of these feelings again</p>

        <p>As they all sitting here caught in helplessness<br>
          imagenary bonds at hands and feet<br>
          and know look at us like we're sitting here alone<br>
          in the dirt in the mid of million other people</p>

        <p>Is it the fear, of getting hurt in front<br>
          or is it the covidence of something to do</p>

        <p>And i thought i never die for you<br>
          and i thought i never try for you<br>
          but know you reign my world<br>
          And i thought i never die for you<br>
          and i thought i never try for you<br>

          No matter what happend we're able to fix<br>
          Your eyes on fire, as you drag him towards the door<br>
          Your bags so heavy, leavin marks across the floor</p>

        <p>I suppose you cant reach the mark of all your saints<br>
          You aim too high, and I'm just trying to keep it straight<br>
          Worse times are coming and I don't have to tell you,<br>
          Good luck my girl, where ever you will go</p>

        <p>I guess, I win, goodbye Again<br>
          Go spread the news, oh and don't forget your shoes<br>
          It's going to be a long walk<br>
          And you know what you could lose<br>
          Oh, when you've got mountains to move</p>

        <p>The same as we split, my thoughts are with you<br>
          I dont know where you are, i dont know what you do<br>
          But i believe you feeling cold and alone<br>
          Just one question, is it what you're looking for</p>

        <p>I guess, I win, Goodbye Again<br>
          Go spread the news,<br>
          Oh and don't forget your shoes<br>
          It's going to be a long walk<br>
          And you know what you could lose<br>
          Oh, when you've got mountains to move</p>

        <p>I guess, I win, Goodbye Again<br>
          Go spread the news,<br>
          Oh and don't forget your shoes<br>
          it's going to be a long walk<br>
          And you know what you could lose<br>

        <h2>Remember</h2>

        <p>Do you remember, we were young<br>
        Ungainly but always together on the run</p>

        <p>It did not matter what they thought<br>
        We did our thing and it was good</p>

        <p>And you remember - remember</p>

        <p>And all these times remain<br>
        in which we laughed together out loud<br>
        and danced in the rain like there is<br>
        no tomorrow morning</p>

        <p>Whenever i cried you were there<br>
        have wiped my tears of my wenge</p>

        <p>You've turned my world upside down<br>
        and saved my Soul from drowning down</p>

        <p>And you remember - remember</p>

        <p>And all these times remain<br>
        in which we laughed together out loud<br>
        and danced in the rain like there is<br>
        no tomorrow morning</p>

        <p>And all these times remain<br>
        in which we laughed together out loud<br>
        and danced in the rain like there is<br>
